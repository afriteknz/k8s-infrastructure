### This repository documents my Kubernetes (EKS & AKS) journey, emphasizing my general understanding of how one can use it to deploy microservices applications.

I will demonstrate my k8s understanding seperating 

- Infrastructure components - deployment, management and monitoring
- Application components - deployment, management and monitoring

#### What inspired this repo 

How many can confidently say they understand the Kubernetes ecosystem? Probably just a few. To address this, I've decided to document my experiences with Kubernetes. This documentation will serve as a valuable reference for all my future projects involving Kubernetes, particularly AKS and EKS.

Ultimately, my goal isn't necessarily to master every aspect of Kubernetes. Instead, I aim to understand kubernetes core fundamentals enough to be able to host microservices developed in either Java, C#, PHP, Python and any of the morden languages.

This practical approach guides my efforts, prioritizing operational effectiveness over exhaustive comprehension.

#### Docker & Kubernetes - Understanding the relationship



##### What is Docker and how does it work?


The diagram below shows the architecture of Docker and how it works when we run ‚Äúdocker build‚Äù, ‚Äúdocker pull‚Äù and ‚Äúdocker run‚Äù. 

![alt text](images/docker.png)
 
There are 3 components in Docker architecture: 
 
üîπ Docker client 
The docker client talks to the Docker daemon. 
 
üîπ Docker host 
The Docker daemon listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. 
 
üîπ Docker registry 
A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use. 
 
Let‚Äôs take the ‚Äúdocker run‚Äù command as an example. 
1. Docker pulls the image from the registry. 
2. Docker creates a new container. 
3. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container. 
4. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network. 
5. Docker starts the container. 

Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that encapsulate all the dependencies required to run an application.

Key Components:

Docker Engine: The core component of Docker, responsible for building, running, and managing containers. It consists of:

Docker Daemon: The background process that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes.
Docker CLI: The command-line interface used to interact with Docker Daemon.
Images: Read-only templates that contain the application code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and other files required for the application to run.

Containers: Runnable instances of Docker images. Containers isolate the application and its dependencies from the underlying infrastructure, ensuring consistency across different environments.

Dockerfile: A text file that contains instructions for building Docker images. It specifies the base image, environment variables, dependencies, and commands needed to set up the application environment.

Key Concepts:

Containerization: The process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a container. This allows the application to run consistently across different environments, from development to production.

Layered File System: Docker uses a layered file system to optimize image builds and minimize storage space. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer, making it possible to reuse existing layers when building new images.

Networking: Docker provides networking capabilities to enable communication between containers and other networked services. Users can create custom networks to isolate containers or connect them to external networks.

Volumes: Docker volumes provide persistent storage for containers. Volumes enable data to persist even after a container is stopped or deleted, making them suitable for storing application data, logs, and configuration files.

Use Cases:

Application Deployment: Docker simplifies the deployment process by encapsulating applications and their dependencies into containers. This enables developers to deploy applications more efficiently and consistently across different environments.

Microservices Architecture: Docker is well-suited for building and deploying microservices-based applications. Each microservice can be packaged into a separate container, allowing for better scalability, isolation, and maintainability.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Docker facilitates the adoption of CI/CD practices by providing a consistent environment for building, testing, and deploying applications. Docker images can be automatically built, tested, and deployed using CI/CD pipelines.

Development Environments: Docker can be used to create lightweight, reproducible development environments. Developers can use Docker to quickly set up development environments 

#### General Kubernetes Architecture

- Master nodes for control plane operations
- Worker nodes for executing application workloads



#### I have broken down this repo into 4 subfolders folders

##### EKS Platform
- Contains terraform code to deploy EKS infrastructure on AWS.
##### EKS Applications
- Contains different microservice applications in C#, Java springboot, node & Python
##### AKS Platform
- Contains terraform code to deploy EKS infrastructure on Azure.

Excited to share insights into my latest project leveraging Terraform to automate the provisioning of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster! üåêüí°
In this project, I focused on automating the deployment of various resources to support the AKS cluster enhancing security and isolating network resources using a Service Principal. The deployment unfolded in the following key steps:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Network Creation: A secure space for hosting the AKS cluster, ensuring isolation from other network resources.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Container Registry: Ensuring secure and private container image management.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Key Vault: A centralized vault to securely store sensitive information like client secrets.
4Ô∏è‚É£ AKS Cluster Setup: Configuration of nodes for running containerized applications, with specifications defined using Terraform for automatic scaling and adaptability.
üîó Check out the GitHub repo https://lnkd.in/dyJG4f_M for a detailed look into the project architecture and configurations.

Excited to hear your thoughts and feedback on this journey! Let's continue pushing the boundaries of automation and secure cloud deployments. üíªüåê
Feel free to customize it further to match your personal style and preferences!


##### AKS Applications
- Contains different microservice applications in C#, Java springboot, node & Python


#### For both EKS and AKS, you need 2 things:

    - A cluster
    - A way to deploy workloads into the cluster


##### History Lesson ###################






##### Namespaces 


In Kubernetes, #namespaces are the linchpin for organizing and securing resources within a unified cluster, crucial for upholding structure and safeguarding data in multi-tenancy setups.

Multi-tenancy where each customer is running the same instance of a vendor application, although the data being used in the app is completed isolated from other. 

In this example, ![alt text](images/image.png)

by changing the namespaces within the #Kubernetes manifest, different instances of the #webRTC application can be deployed, ensuring that each tenant operates within their own isolated environment or domain, effectively managing resources and maintaining security in a multi-tenancy setup.

Below are a list of benefits you get when you take advantage of namespaces in Kubernetes

- Isolation: Separates teams or clients, maintains resource and access control.

- Resource Management: Efficiently allocates and manages CPU, memory, storage.

- Security: Ensures precise access control and data privacy.

- Quotas and Limits: Enforces resource quotas, prevents exhaustion.

- Customization: Tailors configurations to specific requirements.

- Monitoring and Logging: Simplifies monitoring, offers better insight.

- Scaling and Upgrades: Facilitates seamless scaling, minimizes impact.


##### Performance optimization is all about three things

1. Cost Optimization
2. Kubernetes Resource Optimization
3. Worker Node Optimization
